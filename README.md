# ExpandableRecycleViewAdapter
Allow you to use same features like the ExpandableListAdapter. You define view types for groups and children.

##Demo
See <a href="https://youtu.be/FTSeDt0QICU">here</a>

##How to use
Write your adapter and extend either `ExpandableRecycleViewAdapter` or `ExpandableRecycleViewBaseAdapter`. In general, you just need the first.

##Unknowing issue
If you give transparent colors for all items when using `RecyclerView.ItemDecoration`. You will see they are not animating when items are animating with notifing.
